        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>680g chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
            <li>30g hot pepper paste</li>
            <li>61g yogurt</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1g dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1g ground cumin</li>
            <li>1g paprika</li>
            <li>3g kosher salt</li>
            <li>1g ground black pepper</li>
            <li>30ml olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the chicken thighs into thin strips, about Â¼ of an inch thick. Add the sliced chicken to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>In a food processor or blender add the garlic, hot pepper paste, yogurt, lemon juice, oregano, parsley, rosemary, ground ginger, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper and olive oil. Blend until nice and smooth then pour over the chicken and mix to coat all the chicken in the marinade. Let sit for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat your broiler on high. Spread the ghee or tallow all over a large sheet tray and then spread the marinated chicken out into one even layer. Broil for 5-8 minutes until the chicken begins to brown and char slightly, turn all the chicken to broil the other side and continue broiling for about 5-6 minutes until all the chicken is nicely charred.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the broiler and transfer the chicken to a large shallow pan or heat proof dish.</li>
            <h4>Optional Step:</h4>
            <li>Fill a small bowl with oil and set it in the center of the cooked chicken. Drop in a hot coal to create smoke then over the pot or dish and allow the chicken to smoke for 4-5 minutes. Discard the oil and coal and set the chicken aside.</li>
        </ol>

# Project: Odin Recipes

This project aims to reinforce HTML skills through the creation of a basic recipe website. The website structure consists of an index page linking to various recipe pages.

Here's a breakdown of what I'll be learning and demonstrating:

1. HTML Structure: By creating HTML files for both the main index page and individual recipe pages, I'll be structuring content using appropriate headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. This foundational skill will serve as the backbone of my web development journey.

2. File Organization: Learning to organize project files within directories is crucial for maintaining a clean and manageable codebase. By separating the main index page from recipe pages, I'll enhance project clarity and ease of navigation.

3. Linking: Establishing seamless navigation between pages is essential for providing users with a cohesive browsing experience. Through practice with anchor tags in the index page, I'll ensure smooth transitions to specific recipe pages.

4. Content Management: The incorporation of various content elements, such as images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions, will elevate the usability and comprehensiveness of the website. This aspect of the project will sharpen my skills in presenting information effectively.

5. GitHub Workflow: Embracing Git commands for version control and collaboration is indispensable for professional web development. By committing frequently, tracking changes diligently, and pushing code to a GitHub repository, I'll cultivate good habits and adhere to best practices in project management.
